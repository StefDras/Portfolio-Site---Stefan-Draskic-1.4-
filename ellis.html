          <h3>How Ellis came to be?</h3>
          <p>
            271 million. That is the number of people worldwide that moved to another country in 2019, according to UN data. Their background, demographics, motives are all varied, but they all have one thing in common - they need timely and accurate information about the new home, coming from a credible source and presented in a logical and easily understandable way.
            This was the starting point of the Discovery phase, which included drafting problem statements, analysing the competition and testing the hypotheses through interviews and surveys.
          </p>

          In order to get a better understanding of the problem I was trying to solve, I designed a problem- solution-expected result loop for the three main hypotheses. The initial hypotheses were then
          tested via 45'-long direct interviews with 4 users and a 14-question online survey that collected answers from 18 respondents.

          <h3>Concepting</h3>

          <p>
          After the interviews, feedback was thoroughly analysed in order to lay the ground for the creation of User Personas and of their flows through the app - crucial for getting the first glimpse of the pages that needed to be designed and their content.
          </p>

          <h3>Information Architecture & Wireframing</h3>

          The next project phase involved creating a sitemap - refined through a card-sorting exercise and low-, mid- and hi-fidelity wireframes, using pen&paper at first and then design tools (Balsamiq and Adobe XD) in the later stage.
          </p>

          <h3>Usability Testing & Design Polishing</h3>

          <p>
          In the next stage, the prototype was taken to usability testing. The feedback received help shape its next version; so did the application of design principles and the heads-up from other fellow designers.
          </p>

          <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
          Looking back at the Ellis project, I am confident that this area of human activity deserves a top-notch digital product - and that Ellis is ready to go into next stages of usability testing and upgrades based on the feedback received.
